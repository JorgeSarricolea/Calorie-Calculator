## Introduction

A few years ago I created a Google Sheets Template sith the same fuctions, to obtain the caloric intake according to physical activity. But the problem when trying to share it was that many acquaintances without knowledge in Excel or Google Sheets found it very difficult to understand, that's why I developed this calculator with a user-friendly experience and a responsive design so that anyone can use it with ease.
